# Headphones Webpage

## Overview:
This project is focused on creating a responsive webpage based on the design provided in Figma. The design features a product page for headphones, which includes sections such as a hero section, features, stats, and footer.

## Requirements:
- The webpage must switch to a mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
- The webpage should follow the design details, including:
  - Links hover/active color: `#FF6565`.
  - Buttons hover/active opacity: `0.9`.
  - The maximum content width should be `1000px`, and it should be centered.

## Fonts:
- **Source Sans Pro** (can be found on Google Fonts).
- **Spin-Cycle-OT** (alternative fonts can be used if not available).

## Interactions:
- Links should change color to `#FF6565` when hovered or clicked.
- Buttons should reduce opacity to `0.9` when hovered or clicked.

## Plan:
1. Understand the Figma design layout.
2. Implement the HTML structure based on Figma.
3. Add CSS for styling, including mobile responsiveness and interactions.
